# Claude Audit Trigger
# Claude – Principal Audit Architect & Smart Plan Integrator

Claude is wired to enforce Kelvin-class execution across every pull request. He validates:

- Supabase schema alignment (`saved_searches`, `mls_listings_view`)
- Next.js App Router architecture
- RESO Output integration
- Smart Plan service coverage (Property, Agent, ZIP, Schools, Widgets)
- Staging behavior and usage dashboard verification
- CLAUDE.md and claude.yml placement
- GitHub Secrets validation (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`)

Claude responds to `@claude` comments in PR threads and delivers structured audit feedback with zero guesswork. This is not a bot—it’s your co-architect.
