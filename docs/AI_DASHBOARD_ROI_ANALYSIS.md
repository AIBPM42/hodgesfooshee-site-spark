## 💎 REVENUE IMPACT

### **Scenario 1: Conservative (5 Pilot Agents)**

#### **Metric Improvements**:
- **Deal Close Rate**: +12% (from AI lead scoring & intent signals)
- **Time to Close**: -18 days (from smart pricing & deal predictor)
- **Listing Price Accuracy**: +3.2% (from AI CMAs & pricing engine)
- **Agent Productivity**: +22% (from automation & AI insights)

#### **Revenue Math**:
```
Current: 5 agents × 2 closings/mo × $12,000 avg commission = $120,000/mo

With AI Dashboard:
- 12% more deals: 5 × 2.24 closings/mo = 11.2 closings
- 3.2% higher prices: $12,000 × 1.032 = $12,384 avg commission
- Revenue: 11.2 × $12,384 = $138,702/mo

Net Gain: $18,702/mo
ROI: $18,702 / $3,035 = 616%
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Realistic (25 Agents)**

- **Listings Per Agent**: +1.8/mo (from AI prospecting tools)
- **Average Sale Price**: +2.1% (from smart pricing)
- **Agent Retention**: +35% (from superior tools)

#### **Revenue Math**:
```
Current: 25 agents × 2 closings/mo × $12,000 = $600,000/mo

With AI Dashboard:
- 15% more deals: 25 × 2.3 closings/mo = 57.5 closings
- 2.1% higher prices: $12,000 × 1.021 = $12,252 avg commission
- Revenue: 57.5 × $12,252 = $704,490/mo

Net Gain: $104,490/mo
ROI: $104,490 / $3,035 = 3,442%

Current: 35 agents × 2 closings/mo × $12,000 = $840,000/mo

With AI Dashboard (at 100 agents):
- 18% more deals: 100 × 2.36 closings/mo = 236 closings
- Better pricing: $12,500 avg commission
- Revenue: 236 × $12,500 = $2,950,000/mo
